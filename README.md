# Ansible 
This is a new repo to house all of the Ansible Randomness I come across. Its pretty empty at the moment, but I will be moving all my roles here. 

# State of the Repo
towerregister.sh - This can be used in a kickstart to auto register machines on provision when no other means of registering them exists. You can also just run it from the command line after, but thats not very automated.
